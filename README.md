# Advent of Code 2025

https://adventofcode.com/2025

## How to run

The project can be built using Bazel.

1. **Build the main solution:**
   > bazel build dayX/dayX

2. **Build the extended solution:**
   > bazel build dayX/dayXext

### Data input

Each day's solution requires an input file. The data is available on the Advent of Code website for each day's challenge.

Place the input file in the `dayX` directory with the appropriate name.  
I used **data_easy.txt** for the small example input and **data.txt** for the full puzzle input.
